### Comprehensive Report on Delayed Flight Analysis Using Power BI Dashboard

**Introduction:**
This report analyzes flight delays based on data visualized through a Power BI dashboard. The analysis focuses on various dimensions, including overall flight volume, delayed vs. non-delayed departures, cancellation causes, delay times, and how these factors vary across airlines and airports. The data is structured monthly and weekly, offering insights into the patterns of delays across different time frames.

### 1. **Overall Flight Volume:**
The total number of flights recorded is **1,048,575**. Monthly breakdowns show the following:
- **January:** 0.47 million flights
- **February:** 0.43 million flights
- **March:** 0.15 million flights

Weekly flight volume follows a typical trend, peaking towards the weekend (Friday, Sunday), while mid-week days such as **Wednesday** and **Tuesday** see lower flight volumes. These fluctuations reflect typical traveler patterns, with higher volumes during weekends【19†source】.

### 2. **Delayed vs. Non-delayed Departures:**
The data reveals that **43.7%** of all flights were delayed, while **56.3%** departed on time:
- **417K** flights experienced delays.
- **537K** flights were non-delayed.

This shows a significant portion of flights face delays, which may lead to broader impacts on airline scheduling, passenger satisfaction, and airport efficiency【19†source】.

### 3. **Average Delay Time:**
The **average delay time** across all flights is **10.91 minutes**. The dashboard breaks down delay percentages across months:
- **January:** 42.35% delayed
- **February:** 41.59% delayed
- **March:** 16.07% delayed.

The sharp decline in delayed flights in March (16.07%) is noticeable compared to the previous months. The reasons for this decrease could be due to operational changes, better weather conditions, or lower overall flight volumes in March (0.15 million flights), leading to less congestion and fewer delays【19†source】.

### 4. **Boston-Specific Delay Data:**
At **Boston Airport**, the delay rate is exceptionally high, with **95.38%** of flights delayed, leaving only **4.62%** of flights departing on time. This highlights a major issue at this specific airport, possibly due to weather, staffing, or operational inefficiencies that need further investigation【19†source】.

### 5. **Flight Cancellations:**
There were **40,527** flight cancellations in the data. A significant majority, **69.73%**, were due to weather conditions, impacting **28K flights**. Security and other reasons caused smaller cancellation percentages (13.06% and 17.2%, respectively).

This emphasizes that while delays are a major issue, weather conditions remain a dominant factor in outright cancellations【19†source】.

### 6. **Airline-Specific Delays:**
The dashboard shows significant variability in departure delays by airline. Key observations include:
- **Southwest Airlines (WN)** has the highest number of delayed departures, nearing **2.0 million** minutes.
- Other airlines such as **Delta (DL)**, **United (UA)**, **American Airlines (AA)**, and **JetBlue (B6)** also show high delay numbers, though lower than Southwest.
- **Smaller carriers** such as **Hawaiian Airlines (HA)** and **Alaska Airlines (AS)** tend to have fewer delays.

This could indicate operational challenges at specific airlines or reflect differences in the number of flights each airline operates【19†source】.

### 7. **Cancellations by Cause:**
The cancellation causes further reinforce that **weather** is the primary factor, accounting for nearly 70% of cancellations, followed by **airline or national air system** issues, **security**, and **miscellaneous** reasons.

This reinforces the notion that external, uncontrollable factors like weather play a major role in flight disruptions【19†source】.

### Conclusion:
The delayed flight analysis reveals several key insights:
- A significant portion of flights, over 40%, face delays, with weather being the primary reason for cancellations.
- Boston Airport stands out with an unusually high percentage of delayed flights, while certain airlines (such as Southwest) face operational challenges leading to higher delays.
- There is a notable difference in the monthly patterns of delays, with January and February experiencing higher delays compared to March.

The data can be used by airlines and airport management to focus on improving operations, especially around busy airports like Boston and for airlines with high delay volumes. Identifying and mitigating the causes of delays, especially weather-related issues, could enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction in the airline industry.
